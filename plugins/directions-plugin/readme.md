## Getting Access

Before using the Plugin in the your solution, please ensure that the related access is enabled in the [Mappls Console](https://apis.mappls.com/console/), in the same project you set up for the Maps SDK.

1. Copy and paste the generated `access token` from your API [keys](https://apis.mappls.com/console/) available in the dashboard in the sample code for interactive map development.
    - This APIs follow OAuth2 based security.
    - `Access Token` can be generated using Token Generation API.
    - To know more on how to create your access tokens, please use our authorization API URL. More details available [here](https://about.mappls.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)
    - The `access token` is a valid by default for 24 hours from the time of generation. This can be configured by you in the API console.
2. The sample codes are provided on our domain to help you understand the very basic functionality of Mappls Direction Plugin. [See Sample Codes here](https://about.mappls.com/api/web-sdk/vector-plugin-example/Direction/mappls-direction-plugin)

## Introduction

This plugin, offered by Mappls Places & Directions SDK for Web, uses integrated places searches for directions for several modes of transportation, including driving, biking and walking.

The plugin offers the following basic functionalities:

1. Integrated support of Mappls(MapmyIndia) Place search for searching locations of origin, destinations and via points.
2. It allows to use origin and destinations in Mappls's digital address (semicolon separated) eLoc or WGS 84 geographical coordinates both.
3.  The ability to set the vehicle profile like driving, biking,trucking and walking.
4. Easily set the resource for traffic and ETA information.

## Add the Direction plugin

### Implementation

## React JS

import { mappls, mappls_plugin } from "mappls-web-maps";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

const mapplsClassObject = new mappls();
const mapplsPluginObject = new mappls_plugin();

const DirectionPlugin = ({ map }) => {
  const directionRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (map && directionRef.current) {
      directionRef.current.remove();
      mapplsClassObject.removeLayer({ map, layer: directionRef.current });
    }

    directionRef.current = mapplsPluginObject.direction(
      {

        annotations: "nodes,congestion",
        map: map,
        start: "28.545,77.545",

      }
    };
  }, [map]);
};

const App = () => {
  const mapRef = useRef(null);
  const [isMapLoaded, setIsMapLoaded] = useState(false);

  const loadObject = { map: true, plugins: ["direction"] };

  useEffect(() => {

        setIsMapLoaded(true);
      });
      mapRef.current = newMap;
    });
    return () => {
      if (mapRef.current) {
        mapRef.current.remove();
      }
    };
